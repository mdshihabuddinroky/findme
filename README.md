🔍🤝 Helping Reunite Loved Ones with Flutter & Python! 🤝🔍

📱 Exciting news! I've created a face recognition app using Flutter and Python, bridging the gap between lost individuals and their concerned relatives. 🌟

💔 When someone goes missing, relatives can now effortlessly add the lost person's details via a simple button click. This ensures their vital information is stored securely in our database.

🔎 On the flip side, if someone finds a lost person, they can snap a photo and instantly search our database for potential matches. Thanks to our face recognition system with an impressive accuracy of 99.38%, we swiftly display any available details.

🌐 This project was designed for learning purposes, so the focus was more on functionality than aesthetics. But hey, we're open to collaboration! If you're interested in developing face recognition apps or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Let's bring loved ones back together! 🤗
